# Movie-Fight

Movie Fight is a fun and interactive web app built with Vanilla JavaScript that lets users search, compare, and analyze movies using data from an external movie API. Users can search for two movies side-by-side, and the app automatically highlights which one “wins” based on ratings, awards, box office performance, and more.
